## **Hey there, I’m Mohammad Sadegh Rategh**

Software Engineer | Data Enthusiast | Linux Guru


I have a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering and a Master’s in Data Mining, with a focus on data privacy and preservation. Over the past decade, I’ve honed my skills in programming, server management, and network architecture, making technology both my passion and career.

For the last ten years, I’ve used Arch Linux and macOS as my primary operating systems, bringing the best of both worlds into my daily routine as a software developer. I have extensive experience setting up and managing Linux-based servers, from small personal projects to large-scale environments.

As a programmer, I’m well-versed in Python, and have used frameworks like Django and Flask to create APIs that handle high volumes of traffic. My stack includes databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and even Redis for caching and RabbitMQ for queue management. I also have experience with ElasticSearch and the ELK stack for log management, helping teams extract valuable insights from their systems.

Apart from my technical skills, I have a deep love for networking, gadgets, and new technologies. I’m always learning and experimenting with the latest advancements. When I’m not working on projects, I enjoy contributing to the tech community by writing guides, sharing tips, and helping others in team settings.

What I Believe In:

- **Continuous Learning**: There’s always something new to explore and improve in tech.
- **Best Practices**: Quality, maintainability, and scalability are key in everything I build.
- **Collaboration**: I believe in helping my peers and contributing to the growth of my team. 

When I’m not working on code, you’ll likely find me experimenting with new gadgets, exploring networking setups, or reading about the latest innovations in the tech world.


Let’s connect and make something amazing together!

I built my blog using Astro with the Astro Paper theme [repo](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper). 
The source code for the blog is available in the [repo](https://github.com/Rategh/Blog) on my GitHub account.
